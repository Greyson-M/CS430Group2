# Front

## Dependencies

- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) (may not be necessary to install globally, as it is included in the project dependencies)

## How to Install

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the front-end directory:

   ```bash
   cd Front/front-app
   ```

3. Install Node.js dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## How to Run

1. In your terminal, navigate to the `Front\front-app` folder.
2. Start the React development server:

   ```

## Troubleshooting

- If the app doesn't run, ensure Node.js is installed with all dependencies.
- You may need to resolve permissions issues in your terminal or PowerShell.
- If you encounter issues with missing packages, delete `node_modules` along with `package-lock.json` and run `npm install` again.
- Ask a robot
- Ask team members.
